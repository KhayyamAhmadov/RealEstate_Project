# üï∑Ô∏è Real Estate Web Scraper

This module is responsible for extracting real estate listing data from three of the most popular Azerbaijani property websites:  
**[Bina.az](https://bina.az)**, **[Emlak.az](https://emlak.az)**, and **[Arenda.az](https://arenda.az)**.

The scraper is designed to run in an automated and parallelized fashion, handling dynamic web pages, anti-bot measures, and structured data extraction. Collected data is cleaned and pushed to a Microsoft SQL Server database for downstream use in analytics and machine learning.
